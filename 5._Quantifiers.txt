====== 5. Quantifiers ======
Created Saturday 13 June 2020

1. Star(*) ⇒ zero or more
2. Plus(+) ⇒ one or more
3. Optional(?) ⇒ zero or one
4. Frequency range:
	a. {a} ⇒ exact number
	b. {a, b} ⇒ **inclusive range**
	c. {a, } ⇒ more than or equal. Less than or equal is represented as {0, b}
5. lazy ⇒ ? ⇒ This is a quantifier, modifier. 
	a. +? will return trimmed matches of the least length. By default, quantifiers are greedy - i.e they return the maximum match.
	b. {2,5}? will select return the least matches of length 2 to 5.

	Because be is the smallest, all matches are made as be.
7. Alteration ⇒ | ⇒ Acts as a boolean OR, and gets shortciruited if match is found. 
Note: AND is implicit everywhere - so it has no symbol.
